# SimpleMMO Seasonal Guild Leaderboard

[SimpleMMO](https://web.simple-mmo.com/) is a lightweight text-based MMORPG that allows players to enjoy a MMO in its simplest form. One aspect of the game is the guild system where players can team up to complete tasks, raids, and guild wars. Unfortunately, the downfall in the game is that the guild leaderboard which tracks the standings of guilds is stagnant. It has been tracking the guilds for the past two years without a reset. This means that there are guilds in the top 10 who are no longer active, yet because they grinded out in the beginning they are still at the top. 


To solve this problem, I have created a seasonal guild leaderboard that resets every two months. This gives way to new competition and a fresh guild leaderboard. It also gives recognition to the newer guilds. These weekly updates to the seasonal guild leaderboard are shared through the Couch Cat YouTube channel and blog posts.
